## proposal

We decided to look at the genomic prediction programme of an insect for feed or human consumption.

### Candidates 

- [X] darkling beetle
- [ ] Locusts
- [ ] crickets
- [ ] soldier fly larvae

## What is needed for a good breeding programme

- We need a target phenotype which is:
	- genetically variable
	- Is not solved via current methods
	- Can be bred via genomic prediction
	- Has a viable genome/ genotyping strategy

## Why Darkling beetle / yellow mealworm (Tenebrio moiitor)

### Phenotypes

- feed conversion
- Pupae life duration
- growth rate
- Resistance breeding
- Macro-nutrient content

### Genome

- A high resolution genome has been produced for yellow mealworm
- See [here](https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/articles/1-94)

### Markets 

- fish
- feed
- food


### Potential for triploid breeding

We will conduct a three-way cross programme to produce a triploid product

- A : Good female line
- B: good female line
- C: Good male line
