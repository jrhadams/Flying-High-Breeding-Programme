## proposal

We decided to look at the genomic prediction programme of an insect for feed or human consumption.

### Candidates 

- [ ] darkling beetle
- [ ] Locusts
- [ ] crickets
- [ ] soldier fly larvae

## What is needed for a good breeding programme

- We need a target phenotype which is:
	- genetically variable
	- Is not solved via current methods
	- Can be bred via genomic prediction
	- Has a viable genome/ genotyping strategy
